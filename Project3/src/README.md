Analyse fruit data set with our FFNN neural network (slow and not recommended):

´´´bash
python3 fruit_NN.py

Color or Black-white [C/Bw]: 
Size of N images (N x N pixels): 
Save network? [Y/n]: 
´´´
 Choose color (C) or gray-scale (Bw), then choose picture resolution (go for something low for quick calculations, e.g. 10). Not neccessary to save network (n)
 
 Analyse fruit data set with Keras neural network (less slow, couple minutes with 50x50 gray-scale):
 
 ´´´bash
python3 fruit_keras.py

Color or Black-white [C/Bw]: 
Size of N images (N x N pixels): 
´´´
 Choose color (C) or gray-scale (Bw), then choose picture resolution (50 takes around 15 min).
