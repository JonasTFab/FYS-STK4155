# Results

Different folders with results from our own neural network (folder **NN**), Keras Neural Network (folder **Keras**), and Keras Convolutional Neural Network (folder **CNN**).

The folders **NN** and **Keras** contain different runs for the network, trained with varying input size of images. Results are confusion matrix and predictions on randomly selected images from test data.

The folder **CNN** contains confusion matrices and accuracy maps made by CNN. The confusion matrices are made with otpimal parameters for gray and coloured images. Accuracy maps are made with different sets of parameters.
