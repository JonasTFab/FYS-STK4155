# Results

Different folders with results from our own neural network (folder **NN**), Keras Neural Network (folder **Keras**), and Keras Convolutional Neural Network (folder **CNN**).

The folders **NN** and **Keras** contain different runs for the network, trained with varying input size of images. Results are confusion matrix and predictions on randomly selected images from test data.

The folder **CNN** contains confusion matrices from CNN.
