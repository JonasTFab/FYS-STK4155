## Convolutional neural networks on fruit recognition

In this project, we analyse a dataset consisting of labelled images of fruit. The dataset is publically available through Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/chrisfilo/fruit-recognition).

We use the Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) developed in [FYS-STK Project 2](https://github.com/jacobllie/FYS-STK4155/tree/master/Project2), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from tensorflow using Keras API. The CNN was made with up of 2D convolution layers (e.g. spatial convolution over images) with [`Conv2D layer`](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/).

Selected results can be found under the folder **results**.

Source code is found under the folder **src**, with documentation on how to run selected scripts.
