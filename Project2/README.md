# Project 2 FYS-STK4155
## Classification and Regression, from linear and logistic re-gression to neural networks

In this project, we explore stochastic gradient descent and feedforward neural networks with back-propagation.

To run the scripts we have made, download our repository and make sure you are in the src folder.

'''bash
cd src
'''

Now, you can run the scripts. We recommend starting with analysing stochastic gradient descent on the Franke data set.
You can do this by running the regression script:

'''bash
python3 regression.py
'''

Now your terminal will hopefully give you the options to analyse minibatches and epochs. Respond with Y for yes or n for no.
The other option to analyse is learning schedule. Both analyses produce a heatmap and saves them in the folder '''figures'''.

The next script we recommend to analyse is the neural network (NN) on the Franke function. Run the following command

'''bash
python3 NN.py
'''

Now you will get options to analyse
